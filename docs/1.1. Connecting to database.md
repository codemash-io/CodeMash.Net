# CodeMash - Database as a Service - Connect to database

There are several options to get in touch with your database instance. By default when you create an account on CodeMash, we create MongoDb database for you. You can replace it 
with your own MongoDb and that's totally fine for us ;)

First option is see database and manage it through : <a target="_blank" href="http://cloud.codemash.io/db">CodeMash database manager.</a> Just be sure that instance is exposed and you can connect remotely. 

Second option - using your prefered IDE. In case you are noob, please follow insturction defined below : 

1. Download and install your prefered MongoDb IDE - either <a target="_blank" href="https://robomongo.org/">robomongo</a> or other which supports SCRAM-SHA-1 authentication. Our MongoDB engine uses the SCRAM-SHA-1 as the default challenge and response authentication mechanism.  
2. Register an account or login to <a target="_blank" href="http://cloud.codemash.io">CodeMash dashboard</a> 
3. On CodeMash dashboard go to <a target="_blank" href="http://cloud.codemash.io/connections/db">Connections</a> and find connection called MongoDb
4. Copy the database credentials to MongoDb IDE or shell and you will be allowed connect to your own database. 

N.B : By using Starter plan you are not able connect to database using IDE, use <a target="_blank" href="http://cloud.codemash.io/db">CodeMash database manager</a> instead. More about database management you can find at  <a target="_blank" href="http://codemash.io/documentation/db/mongodb">CodeMash documentation.</a>
