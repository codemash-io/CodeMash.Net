# CodeMash - Database - Connect to Database

When you enable a database service in your [CodeMash dashboard page](https://cloud.codemash.io/) we create a new MongoDb database for you. After that is done you are able to create collections using our provided tools in the dashboard. After you create a collection you can start adding records through the dashboard or using provided SDK.

### 1.1. Create a Client

For database and all other services you need to create a client to be able to send requests to our servers.

```csharp
var projectId = Guid.Parse("{YOUR_PROJECT_ID}");
var apiKey = "{YOUR_SECRET_KEY}";

var client = new CodeMashClient(apiKey, projectId);
```

### 1.2. Initialize database service

After you have created the client you can initialize database service.

```csharp
var service = new CodeMashRepository<Person>(client);
```

Here **Person** is a class which extends interface **IEntity**. More about it in **1.3.** section.

### 1.3. Entities

All your collection classes must extend **IEntity** interface to be able to use database service.

```csharp
[CollectionName("sdk_test")]
public class Person : Entity
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

**_Entity_** - class implementing **IEntity** interface.  
**_CollectionName_** - attribute which tells the name of the collection.
